# Welcome to Open Food Broker!

## What is Open Food Broker?

Currently, it's work in progress to establish a solid foundation of elementary
data definion and APIs as well as an overview of existing assets around healthy and tasteful nutrition, including:

* Food products
* Advanced nutrition plans
* Recipe databases

## Why Open Food Broker?

Currently, there are many vendors for data APIs and various apps with some
basic and some unique features.
Still, there is no open foundation addressing a harmonization in this domain.

In future, it should be possible to address community driven development of
advanced algorithms.

## Planned workstreams

* Create documentation base for key domain objects
* Design a scope for reference B2C UI differentiating between basic and advanced features
* In basic feature context, identify relevant existing resources like free data APIs and open source components
* Implement and deploy the first generation of reference OpenFoodBroker APIs.
